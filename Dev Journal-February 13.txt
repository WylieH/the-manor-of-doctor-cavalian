February 13

This week was, again, mostly spent researching.
I've now fully decided on what tools I want to use to make my game.
For the language, I've abandoned my idea to use Python, and am instead going to keep on using java.
As for the libraries, I've abandoned both of the libraries I had planned on using before (lbjsci and ascii).
Instead, I've decided to use the seemingly more streamlined 2D Slick library, one that was specifically made for creating two dimensional games in java.
Slick has an advantage over lbjsci and ascii in that it fully supports the implementation of custom sprites and graphics, a feature that the other two don't support nearly as readily.
As a brief introduction to using Slick, I've begun following a tutorial I've found online.
My completed version of the first step in this tutorial (loading an empty window using the Slick library) will be uploaded as this weeks status update.
