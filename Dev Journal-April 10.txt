This week I've been working on the game's room generator.
So far I've been able to make the main method use the room generator to create the starting room instead of doing it itself.
I've also built the framework to use to build the full randomization/generator, however I haven't gotten that working yet.
I think the room generation is working, but the problem is that I'm not quite sure how to spawn the player in the newly generated room.
Right now the game just crashes when the player hits one of the designated door tiles.
Fixing that will be my priority for this week, but if I finish early I'll being working on the enemies.
If I have room generation, enemies, and combat working, I think that will be enough to consider the game in a working state.
After those top priorities are finished, I'll add in some items.

I've also been working on the asset redesigns, since like I said, I'm really not happy with how they turned out.
However, that's fairly low on the list of necessities, so I've just been doing it in my spare time.
