I spent this week finishing the 2D Slick tutorial that I started last week. 
It’s the same kind of "game" as the prototype, in that it just features basic, 4 directional movements responsive to the arrow keys and collision detection.
However, this version of the game uses a placeholder image instead of the simple @ symbol used previously.
Unfortunately, I'm having difficulties with the classpath, and so although all the code is correct (at least according to what the tutoiral says), the game can't be run without further work.
After the tutorial is finished, however, I’ll be able to build upon the final product to make the actual game.
The major things that still need to be added are health/attack mechanics, enemies, randomly generated rooms, art assets, and a few items that can be picked up, in that order of importance.
These basic features would make the game playable, and if they’re added and time still remains, I will add different room types, boss type enemies, NPCs that can be spoken to, and some semblance of a story, again in that order of importance.
