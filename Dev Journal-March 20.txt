March 20

This week I've mostly just cleaned up the Tester, adding in the properties to the map to make collision detection work.
I also made the map a little bit bigger so that it fills the window open.
I'm not sure how I can make the game toggle between full screen and window mode, so I'll have to look into that later.
However, right now that's fairly low down on my list of priorities.
I've also begun experimenting with a basic attack for the player, but mostly I was working on getting collision detection to work.
I can't test if the damage system works because I have yet to implement enemies, but that's what I'll spend the week after next week doing.
As for next week, since it's Spring Break, I'm going to spend it making the game's actual art assets.
For right now I'm only planning on doing what's really necessary for the game to be somewhat interesting (a few enemy types, a few room types, etc).
Anything more will only be made if I have time.
The art assets are scheduled as my next deliverable, so I need to make sure that they get done soon.
