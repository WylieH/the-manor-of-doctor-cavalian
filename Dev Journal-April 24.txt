I've been continuing on the room generator this week.
After deciding that my previous method of level generation would be too needlessly complex and too prone to random error, I've moved on to a different strategy.
Now I've decided to remove the fill and check methods and create a makePath method, which creates a 2D Integer array with different integers representing different rooms.
The level generator calls this method and then creates a 2D room array based on the values of the integer array.
Unfortunately, I haven't been able to get this to work.
I originally tried to make it so that it created a room in every row at a random location and then filled in the path to connect them all, but again that's become overly complex and I'm having difficulty fixing the errors.
So instead, over the weekend I'm going to remake it so that it creates a room at a random spot in a row, then creates the path leading to the next room, then creates the next room at the end of the path.
I just feel like it will be easier to make the rooms conform to the path than making the path conform to the rooms.
