It works!
It finally works!
After using the TiledMap program to create a basic black and white placeholder map, and after replacing the black placeholder image with it, the program finally runs without errors!
I had originally put off learning TiledMap because I thought I could just use a placeholder JPEG image until I was ready to make the room generator.
However, now that I know that the game doesn't run without it, I've finally used it and I finally got it to work.
The game is running fine now, but there is one small (but probably easily fixable) problem.
When the player image hits the edge of the screen, the game crashes instead of stopping it from moving.
All I have to do to get around that though would just be to add in actual walls and doors just before the edge.
But still, the game finally opens, which means that I can finally begin inputting and testing the actual mechanics.
Unfortunately, I still haven't figured out how to get around the fact that the game doesn't run on the school computers (still not sure why).
Because of that, I'm restricted to doing any testing at home.
I can still write code at school, but it will be significantly more inconvenient since I'd have to a few hours before actually testing it.
But even despite that, the fact that the game runs at all means that things are finally progressing again!
