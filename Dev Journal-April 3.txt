April 3rd

As the April third deliverable, I've finished the sprites for what I believe to be a bare minimum number of enemies that need to be present in the game.
I have four directions for the player sprite, a generic zombie enemy, three bosses for the three levels, and three unique minion enemies for the different levels.
When I have some spare time I'll create more, but this was what I was able to do in the time I gave myself.
Honestly though, I'm somewhat disappointed with how this first batch turned out.
I drew and colored them just on paper, and later scanned them onto the computer.
However, I was borrowing the image scanner, so I wasn't able to see how they would turn out until I had to have the end.'
I had originally hoped that the colors wouldn't look so obviously done in marker, but they really do.
When I get some more spare time, I'm going to recolor the images in Adobe Illustrator, and if they still don't look quite right, I think I'll just try and redesign them from the ground up with a different, even more cartoony art-style.
After that, I'll try and make time to create a few more enemies to add variety, but for now, this is what I have.
Another side project is to add animations.
I certainly won't be able to give every sprite detailed movement and attack animations, and honestly, if I tried to that alone would probably take longer than the actual coding.
But I think I would be able to add just a few more frames, to make them look less lifeless.

Game assets aside, I also began work on the room generator this week.
I wasn't able to make any of the actual randomizes, since that required the custom maps, but I was able to replace the declaration of the placeholder map in the main class with one from the Generator method of the Room class.
Next week I'll be focusing more on getting the room generator working.
